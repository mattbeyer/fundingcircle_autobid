Welcome to FundingCircle Autobid.

Goto www.beyerbeyer.co.uk/fc/auction.php to see live demonstration. Be careful... this uses our real money!
Bid only on auctions that end in six days.
Stop rate must be only 0.2% below top rate available. 

auction.php contains a form allowing user to save:

Auction URL:
The funding circle page that contains information for a specific loan request.

Maximum Live Bids:
Bidding continues in Â£20 amounts until Maximum Lives Bids is reached. Once this is reached the loan page will be repeatedly refreshed to see if user has been outbid. If the user has been outbid the live bid amount will fall below the Maximum Live Bids. Once this happens bidding will continue again.

Stop Rate - bidding and checking of live bids continues until stop rate is reached and autobidding stops.
